# Betting App

The Betting with Open AI POC leverages cutting-edge capabilities of OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5 Turbo to redefine traditional sports betting. This project replaces conventional mathematical modules with AI-driven insights, providing a robust and efficient foundation for sports betting pricing solutions. By integrating AI, the system achieves rapid odds calculations, enhanced resource efficiency, and delivers actionable insights for bookmakers. 

This project is structured around three main components.

### Frontend (OpenAI-POC-UI)

Handles user interactions for team and player selection, as well as displaying odds predictions. 
Technology Stack:
- React with Vite: For building the user interface 
- TypeScript: Ensures types safety and reliability in the UI codebase.
